When you type `https://www.google.com` in your browser and press Enter, a series of complex interactions between various technologies occur to fetch and display the Google homepage. Let’s break down each step of this journey:

1. DNS Request
Domain Name System (DNS) is like the phonebook of the internet. When you type a URL in your browser, the browser first checks if it knows the IP address for the domain. If not, it sends a DNS request to a DNS server to resolve the domain name to an IP address.

- Step 1: The browser checks its cache to see if it already has the IP address for `www.google.com`.

- Step 2: If not found, the request is sent to the local DNS resolver, usually provided by your ISP.

- Step 3: The local resolver checks its cache. If still unresolved, it queries the root DNS servers.

- Step 4: The root server directs the request to the top-level domain (TLD) server, which in this case is the `.com` server.

- Step 5: The TLD server forwards the request to Google’s authoritative DNS server, which finally provides the IP address.

2. TCP/IP
With the IP address obtained, the browser initiates a connection using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** over the **Internet Protocol (IP).

- Step 1: The browser sends a TCP SYN (synchronize) packet to the IP address.

- Step 2: The server responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) packet.

- Step 3: The browser sends an ACK (acknowledge) packet to establish a TCP connection.

This three-way handshake ensures a reliable connection is established between the browser and the server.

3. Firewall:
Firewalls are security systems that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

- Step 1: The packets pass through your local network’s firewall.

- Step 2: The packets may encounter firewalls at various points on the internet.

- Step 3:Finally, the packets pass through Google’s firewall, which protects their servers.

4. HTTPS/SSL
HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) ensures the data transferred between your browser and the server is encrypted using SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security).

- Step 1: The browser requests a secure connection by sending an SSL/TLS handshake.

- Step 2: The server responds with its SSL certificate, containing its public key.

- Step 3: The browser verifies the certificate with a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

- Step 4: A symmetric session key is generated, encrypted with the server’s public key, and sent to the server.

- Step 5: The server decrypts the session key using its private key. Now, all data sent over the connection is encrypted.

5. Load Balancer

Google uses load balancers to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure reliability and performance.

- Step 1: The load balancer receives the request and determines which backend server is best suited to handle the request based on current load and server health.

- Step 2: The request is forwarded to the selected backend server.

6. Web Server
The web server handles the request, serving static content such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.

- Step 1: The load balancer forwards the request to the web server.

- Step 2: The web server processes the request and sends back the appropriate response, such as an HTML file.

7. Application Server
For dynamic content, the request is forwarded to an application server which runs the backend code.

- Step 1: The web server forwards requests for dynamic content to the application server.

- Step 2: The application server executes the backend logic, interacting with databases and other services if needed, and generates the dynamic content.

- Step 3: The generated content is sent back to the web server.

8. Database
If the request requires data storage or retrieval, the database comes into play.

- Step 1: The application server sends a query to the database.

- Step 2: The database processes the query and returns the results to the application server.

- Step 3: The application server uses the data to generate the dynamic content.

Final Steps
- The response from the web server (static or dynamic content) is sent back to the load balancer.

- The load balancer forwards the response to the client’s browser.

- The browser receives the response, processes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and renders the page.
